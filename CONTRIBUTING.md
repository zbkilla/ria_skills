# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Finance Skills! This guide will help you
add new skills or improve existing ones.

## Requesting a Skill

You can suggest new skills by
[opening an issue](https://github.com/JoelLewis/finance_skills/issues/new) with:
- The domain/plugin it belongs to
- A brief description of what the skill would teach Claude
- Example use cases or trigger phrases

## Adding a New Skill

### 1. Choose the right plugin

Skills belong to one of seven plugins. Check `marketplace.json` and the
`plugins/` directory for the full list.

| Plugin | Domain | Skill type |
|--------|--------|------------|
| `core` | Math foundations | Quantitative (Python scripts) |
| `wealth-management` | Investment knowledge | Quantitative (Python scripts for risk/math) |
| `compliance` | US securities regulation | Guidance-only (no scripts) |
| `advisory-practice` | Advisor-facing systems | Guidance-only |
| `trading-operations` | Order lifecycle and execution | Guidance-only |
| `client-operations` | Account lifecycle and servicing | Guidance-only |
| `data-integration` | Reference data and integration | Guidance-only |

### 2. Create the skill directory

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/<skill-name>
```

Directory names use `lowercase-hyphenated` format (e.g., `fixed-income-sovereign`).

### 3. Write the SKILL.md

Every skill needs a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: <one-line description — include trigger phrases for skill matching>
allowed-tools: ["Bash", "Read", "Write", "Edit"]
---
```

The `name` field must match the directory name exactly.

### 4. Follow the template

All skills share a common structure (see `CLAUDE.md` for the canonical
template):

- **No Purpose, Layer, or Direction body sections** — triggering lives in
  the frontmatter `description`; the body opens with domain content
- **Core Concepts** — the domain knowledge
- **Worked Examples** — concrete scenarios with analysis (move to
  `references/examples.md` if the body exceeds ~250 lines)
- **Common Pitfalls** — mistakes to watch for
- **Cross-References** — links to related skills in other plugins
- **Time anchoring** — any indexed threshold, rate, or effective date
  carries an as-of anchor (e.g. "$X as of 2026")
- Script-bearing skills include a **## Running the script** section with the
  exact invocation and a `--verify` mode

**Quantitative skills** (core, wealth-management) additionally include:
- **Key Formulas** — reference table with expressions and use cases
- **Reference Implementation** — pointer to Python script in `scripts/`

**Guidance-only skills** (compliance, operations) use scenario-based examples:
- **Scenario** / **Compliance Issues** / **Analysis** format
- Cite specific rule numbers and act sections inline
- Do not include Key Formulas or Reference Implementation sections

### 5. Add Python scripts (quantitative skills only)

Only `core` and `wealth-management` skills get Python scripts. Scripts should:
- Target Python 3.11+ with only numpy/scipy/pandas dependencies
- Be standalone (runnable without installation)
- Use class-based organization with static methods
- Include type hints and docstrings
- Match the formulas documented in the corresponding SKILL.md
- Use `lowercase_underscore` naming (e.g., `fixed_income_sovereign.py`)

```
plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md           # Required
└── scripts/           # Quantitative skills only
    └── <name>.py
```

### 6. Add cross-references

Update the Cross-References section in both the new skill and any related existing
skills. Cross-references should include the plugin name and a brief description of
the relationship.

### 7. Add evals (required for every new skill)

New skills must ship with evals before they are merged:

- **Output evals:** at least **3 entries in `evals/evals.json`**, each with a
  realistic prompt, an `expected_output` description, and concrete
  `assertions` (use the existing types: `contains_concept`,
  `numerical_accuracy`, `depth_check`, `conceptual_focus`, `absence`).
- **Trigger queries:** at least **4 entries in `evals/trigger/queries.json`**
  — 2 should-trigger queries labeled with your skill name and 2 near-miss
  should-not-trigger queries labeled `null`, assigned to an appropriate
  cluster (add a new cluster if your skill collides with a sibling skill).
- **Baseline run:** before submitting, run your prompts once with the skill
  installed and once without, and grade both with
  `finance-skills-workspace/grade_responses.py`. Include the with/without
  pass rates in your PR description. If the with-skill run does not beat or
  match the baseline, the skill needs more depth or sharper assertions.

### 8. Keep both plugin manifests in sync

Each plugin has **two** manifest files, and both must be updated together
whenever versions, descriptions, or the skill list change:

- `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the **canonical** Claude Code
  plugin spec file (this is what the marketplace and plugin loader read)
- `plugins/<name>/plugin.json` — the repo's extended manifest (adds
  `dependencies`, `skills`, `tags`, `scripts` used by `install.sh` and docs)

Do not delete either file. If you add or remove a skill, update the `skills`
array in `plugins/<name>/plugin.json`, the counts in `marketplace.json` and
`CLAUDE.md`, and keep the description/version identical across both
plugin.json files.

## Improving Existing Skills

1. Read the existing skill thoroughly
2. Keep changes focused and minimal
3. Ensure compliance skills still cite specific rule numbers
4. Ensure quantitative skills still have matching formulas in SKILL.md and scripts
5. Update cross-references if the change affects related skills

## Submitting Your Contribution

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-skill-name`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test locally with Claude Code to verify the skill works
5. Submit a pull request with a description of what the skill teaches
