## Installation

### Option 1: Claude Code Marketplace (Recommended)

Install via Claude Code's built-in plugin system:

```bash
/install JoelLewis/finance_skills
```

### Option 2: npx skills

Use [npx skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) to install skills directly:

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add JoelLewis/finance_skills

# Install specific plugins
npx skills add JoelLewis/finance_skills --plugin wealth-management

# List available plugins
npx skills add JoelLewis/finance_skills --list
```

### Option 3: install.sh (Symlink)

Clone the repo and use the included installer, which symlinks skills into your
project so updates are reflected immediately:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoelLewis/finance_skills.git
cd finance_skills

# Install a single plugin
./install.sh --plugin wealth-management --target /path/to/your/project

# Install all plugins
./install.sh --plugin all --target /path/to/your/project

# List available plugins
./install.sh --list
```

The installer always installs `core` first (implicit dependency), then any declared
plugin dependencies, then symlinks each skill into `<target>/.claude/skills/`.

### Option 4: Clone and Copy

Copy skills directly without symlinks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoelLewis/finance_skills.git
mkdir -p /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills

# Copy a single plugin
cp -r finance_skills/plugins/core/skills/* /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/
cp -r finance_skills/plugins/wealth-management/skills/* /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/

# Or copy everything
for plugin in finance_skills/plugins/*/; do
  cp -r "$plugin"skills/* /path/to/your/project/.claude/skills/
done
```

### What Gets Installed

## Skill Template

Each SKILL.md follows a consistent structure:

- **Purpose** — what the skill enables Claude to do
- **When to Use** — trigger phrases and situations
- **Core Concepts** — the domain knowledge, with formulas where applicable
- **Key Formulas** — reference table (quantitative skills only)
- **Worked Examples** — concrete scenarios with step-by-step analysis
- **Common Pitfalls** — mistakes to watch for
- **Cross-References** — links to related skills in other plugins
- **Reference Implementation** — pointer to Python script (quantitative skills only)

Compliance and operations skills use scenario-based examples
(**Scenario / Compliance Issues / Analysis**) and cite specific rule numbers inline.
Quantitative skills include worked numerical examples and runnable Python scripts.

## What Are Plugins?

Each plugin is a collection of SKILL.md files (and optional Python reference scripts)
that teach Claude domain knowledge. When installed, Claude can:

- Answer domain-specific questions with regulatory citations and worked examples
- Flag compliance concerns during design discussions
- Generate and explain financial computations
- Assist with building, evaluating, or integrating with financial systems

Plugins are independently installable — pull only the domains your project needs. The
`core` plugin is implicit and always included.

## Plugin Architecture

### Design Principles
- **`core` is implicit** — always installed; every plugin depends on it
- **Plugins are independently installable** — a project pulls only the domains it needs
- **Cross-plugin references are allowed** — skills reference related skills in other plugins via cross-references section
- **Skills live in `.claude/skills/`** — installation symlinks a plugin's skills into the target project's skill directory
- **No Python scripts for guidance-only skills** — compliance/operations plugins are guidance-only; quantitative plugins may have `scripts/` subdirectories

### Plugin Dependency Graph

```
core (implicit — always installed)
  ├── wealth-management
  ├── compliance  ←── (recommended for all plugins)
  ├── advisory-practice  ←── depends on wealth-management
