# Client Reporting and Delivery

## Core Concepts

### Client Reporting Architecture

The reporting pipeline in an advisory firm flows from data sources through a generation engine to client delivery. The primary data sources are the portfolio management system (PMS), custodian data feeds, financial planning tools, and the billing system. Each source contributes distinct data elements: the PMS provides portfolio holdings, performance calculations, and asset allocation; the custodian provides official transaction records, settled positions, and tax lot data; the financial planning tool provides goal progress and projection data; and the billing system provides fee calculations and payment history.

Report types span the full advisory relationship:

- **Quarterly performance reports** — The cornerstone deliverable. Summarizes portfolio performance, allocation, holdings, and transactions for the quarter with trailing period returns.
- **Annual reviews** — Comprehensive year-in-review combining performance, planning progress, and forward outlook. Often presented in person.
- **Financial plan updates** — Progress toward goals, updated projections, and recommended adjustments. May be quarterly or semi-annual.
- **Tax reports** — Realized gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses, cost basis reports, 1099 supplements, wash sale reports, and tax-loss harvesting summaries.
- **Billing summaries** — Detailed fee calculations showing AUM tiers, fee rates, amounts debited, and billing period.
- **Custom and ad-hoc reports** — Client-requested reports outside the standard cycle, such as a holdings detail for a mortgage application or a performance report for a specific date range.

Reporting platforms fall into several categories. PMS-embedded reporting tools (Orion Portfolio Solutions, Black Diamond, Tamarac Reporting) generate reports directly from the portfolio management database, ensuring data consistency. Standalone reporting platforms (e.g., Addepar) aggregate data from multiple sources and offer advanced customization, often favored by firms serving UHNW clients and family offices. (Backstop Solutions, sometimes miscategorized here, is an institutional research-management/CRM platform rather than a client reporting tool.) Client portal integration layers the reporting function into a broader digital client experience.

Custodian statements and advisor-produced reports serve complementary but distinct purposes. Custodian statements are the official record of account activity and positions, produced by the custodian (Schwab, Fidelity, Pershing). Advisor-produced reports add value through consolidated household views, custom benchmarks, goal-based framing, blended performance across custodians, and advisor commentary. Clients receive both, and firms should help clients understand the relationship between the two, particularly when minor data differences arise from timing or methodology.

### Report Content and Structure

A well-designed quarterly performance report follows a logical structure that guides the client from high-level summary to supporting detail:

1. **Cover page** — Firm branding, client or household name, reporting period, key headline metrics (total portfolio value, period return, net change in value). The cover page sets the tone and provides the most critical data points at a glance.

2. **Executive summary and market commentary** — A brief narrative (typically one page) covering market conditions during the period, key events that affected portfolios, and a forward-looking perspective. This section can be firm-level (same for all clients) or personalized by the advisor.

3. **Portfolio summary** — Asset allocation (current vs target, shown as pie chart or bar chart and table), total holdings count, cash position, and net deposits/withdrawals during the period. Household-level view aggregating all accounts.

4. **Performance summary** — Period returns (MTD, QTD, YTD, 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year, since inception) with benchmark comparison. Displayed as both table and chart. Net-of-fee returns as the primary presentation with gross-of-fee available.

5. **Account detail** — Individual account summaries within the household, each showing account type, custodian, value, allocation, and performance. Important for clients with multiple accounts across different registration types.

6. **Holdings detail** — Complete listing of positions by account or by asset class, showing security name, ticker, shares/units, market value, percentage of portfolio, unrealized gain/loss, and yield.

7. **Transaction summary** — Purchases, sales, income received, contributions, withdrawals, and fee debits during the period. Level of detail varies by client preference.

8. **Fee summary** — Advisory fees charged during the period, showing calculation methodology (AUM, billing rate, proration if applicable). Increasingly important given regulatory emphasis on fee transparency.

9. **Disclosures and disclaimers** — Required legal language including past performance disclaimers, benchmark descriptions, fee impact disclosure, and firm registration information.

Content customization by client segment is essential. Mass affluent clients typically prefer simplified reports emphasizing total value, return, and allocation with minimal holdings detail. High-net-worth (HNW) clients generally want comprehensive reports including full holdings, transaction detail, and benchmark comparisons. Ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) and family office clients often require institutional-grade reporting with performance attribution, alternative investment detail, multi-entity consolidation, and custom analytics. The challenge is balancing comprehensiveness with readability — a 40-page report that goes unread serves no one.

### Performance Presentation in Reports

Performance is the most scrutinized section of any client report. Presenting returns accurately and clearly requires attention to methodology, time periods, benchmarks, and context.

**Return methodologies:** For TWR vs. MWR definitions and calculation, see the wealth-management performance-metrics and performance-reporting skills. In client reports: TWR is the standard for strategy evaluation; MWR answers "how did my money do?" and is increasingly presented alongside TWR. Presenting both can be powerful when accompanied by a brief explanation of the difference — when the two diverge significantly, it signals that cash flow timing had a material impact and opens a productive conversation.

**Return periods:**

Standard periods displayed in quarterly reports include MTD (month-to-date), QTD (quarter-to-date), YTD (year-to-date), trailing 1-year, trailing 3-year, trailing 5-year, trailing 10-year, and since-inception. Annualization conventions are critical: returns for periods exceeding one year should be annualized (geometric annualization), while returns for periods of one year or less should be presented as cumulative (non-annualized). Mixing conventions without clear labeling is a common source of confusion and potential compliance issues.

**Benchmark selection and display:**

Every portfolio should have a clearly defined benchmark. The primary benchmark should reflect the portfolio's strategic asset allocation and investment universe. For diversified portfolios, a blended benchmark (e.g., 60% MSCI ACWI / 40% Bloomberg US Aggregate) is more appropriate than a single index. Reports should include the benchmark description, component indices and weights, and a note that the benchmark is not investable and does not reflect fees. Some firms also display peer group comparisons or risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio) for sophisticated clients.

**Net-of-fee vs gross-of-fee returns:**

Net-of-fee returns are the preferred presentation for client reports because they represent the client's actual experience after paying advisory fees. Gross-of-fee returns may be shown alongside net for transparency or for GIPS-compliant presentations. The fee impact over long periods is substantial and should not be obscured.

**GIPS compliance considerations:**

Firms that claim compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards must adhere to specific presentation requirements in composite reports, including required disclosures, composite construction rules, and prescribed return calculation methodologies. Individual client reports are not composites, but firms claiming GIPS compliance should ensure client-level reporting does not contradict or undermine their composite presentations.

**Performance disclaimers:**

Every report displaying performance data must include disclaimers stating that past performance is not indicative of future results, describing the benchmark and its limitations, disclosing whether returns are net or gross of fees, and noting any material factors affecting comparability across periods (e.g., strategy change, benchmark change).

### Report Customization and Personalization

Report customization operates at multiple levels, from firm-wide template design to individual client preferences.

**Level of detail:** Some clients want a two-page summary; others want 30 pages of detail. The reporting system should support configurable section inclusion, allowing advisors to toggle sections on or off per client. Common toggleable sections include holdings detail, transaction detail, individual account breakdowns, and performance attribution.

**Grouping and organization:** Reports can organize portfolio data in several ways depending on client preference and portfolio structure:

- **By account** — Each account presented separately, useful for clients focused on specific account objectives (IRA vs taxable).
- **By asset class** — All holdings grouped by asset class across accounts, useful for clients focused on overall allocation.
- **By goal or sleeve** — Holdings grouped by investment objective (retirement, education, legacy), useful for goal-based planning relationships.
- **By manager or strategy** — Holdings grouped by underlying manager or model portfolio, useful for multi-manager platforms.

**Household vs account-level reporting:** Most clients prefer a consolidated household view as the primary presentation, with account-level detail as a secondary section. The household view enables total portfolio allocation, consolidated performance, and a single net worth perspective. Account-level detail remains important for tax planning, beneficiary considerations, and account-specific objectives.

**Custom benchmarks:** Clients with unique portfolio constraints (ESG exclusions, concentrated stock positions, alternative allocations) may require custom benchmarks that reflect their investable universe. The reporting system should support advisor-defined blended benchmarks with custom weights and component indices, updated as the target allocation evolves.

**Personalized commentary:** The highest-value customization is advisor-written commentary specific to the client's situation. This might address recent portfolio changes, progress toward financial plan goals, upcoming planning actions, or responses to client questions. Some firms provide a firm-level market commentary as a default with an editable field for advisor personalization. Advisors who consistently add personalized commentary report stronger client engagement and retention.

**White-labeling:** Multi-advisor firms, RIA aggregators, and sub-advisory relationships often require white-labeled reports carrying the presenting firm's branding rather than the platform or TAMP provider's branding. The reporting system should support configurable logos, firm names, disclosures, and contact information.

**Language and terminology:** Reports should use language appropriate to the client's financial sophistication. A retired schoolteacher needs different terminology than a former CFO. Avoid unnecessary jargon where plain language suffices, but do not oversimplify for sophisticated clients who expect precision.

### Delivery Channels and Methods

Report delivery has evolved from exclusively print-and-mail to a multi-channel environment. Firms must manage several delivery methods simultaneously.

**Client portal (primary digital channel):**

The client portal is the hub of digital delivery. Reports are published to the portal where clients can view them online, download as PDF, and access historical reports in an archive. Portal-based delivery offers several advantages: immediate availability (no mail delay), persistent access (clients can revisit reports anytime), reduced cost (no printing or postage), environmental sustainability, and integration with other portal features (real-time portfolio view, document vault, secure messaging). The portal should provide notification (email or push) when new reports are available.

**Email delivery:**

Email delivery remains common, typically as an encrypted PDF attachment or a link to the client portal. Email is familiar and requires no portal login, making it accessible for less tech-savvy clients. However, email delivery raises security concerns (sensitive financial data in transit or in inboxes), so best practices include PDF encryption with a client-specific password, secure email platforms, or portal links rather than attachments. Firms should document email delivery preferences and security measures.

**Print and mail:**

Physical printed reports delivered via postal mail are declining but not extinct. Some clients, particularly older individuals or those in jurisdictions with specific requirements, prefer or require printed reports. Print delivery involves additional cost (printing, paper, postage), longer delivery time (days vs instant), and environmental impact. Firms transitioning to digital-first delivery should maintain a print capability for clients who opt in and for any regulatory requirements that mandate physical delivery.

**In-person review:**

Many advisors present reports during client meetings rather than simply delivering them. The meeting context allows the advisor to walk through results, provide context, answer questions in real time, and connect performance to financial plan progress. In-person presentation may use the same PDF report, a slide-deck derivative, or an interactive portal screen share. The report serves as both a leave-behind document and a meeting framework.

**Multi-channel strategy:**

The recommended approach is digital-first with print opt-in. Default delivery is portal publication with email notification. Clients who prefer print explicitly opt in and receive mailed copies in addition to (not instead of) digital access. This ensures every client has portal access to current and historical reports while accommodating print preferences.

**E-delivery consent:**

SEC rules on electronic delivery (primarily from SEC guidance releases and interpretive letters) require that firms provide notice that documents are available electronically, ensure the client has access to the electronic format, and obtain evidence of delivery (or evidence of notice with access). Firms should document client consent to electronic delivery, provide clear instructions for portal access, and maintain systems that confirm report availability and client access. Under FINRA rules, broker-dealers have additional requirements for implied consent and opt-out rights.

**Delivery confirmation and tracking:**

Firms should track report delivery status: portal published, email sent, email opened (if tracked), portal accessed, print mailed, print delivered (via tracking number if warranted). Delivery tracking supports compliance (evidence of delivery), operations (identifying delivery failures), and client service (confirming clients received their reports).

### Report Generation Workflow

The quarterly reporting cycle is a firm's most operationally intensive recurring process, typically spanning T+5 to T+15 after quarter-end (5 to 15 business days after the quarter closes).

**Workflow stages:**

1. **Data finalization (T+1 to T+5):** Custodian data feeds settle, reconciliation between PMS and custodian records completes, corporate actions process, and pricing finalizes. Reports cannot be generated until data is clean. The most common delay is waiting for custodian reconciliation to complete, particularly for accounts holding alternative investments, private placements, or international securities with delayed settlement.

2. **Report generation (T+5 to T+7):** Batch report generation runs for all client accounts and households. The PMS or reporting platform compiles data into report templates, calculates performance for all required periods, generates charts and tables, and produces PDF output. Batch runs may take several hours for large firms (thousands of accounts). Exception reports flag accounts with data issues that prevent clean report generation.

3. **Quality assurance (T+7 to T+9):** QA is the critical gate between generation and delivery. The QA process includes automated validation (returns within expected ranges, AUM totals match PMS, fee calculations correct, no missing data fields) and manual spot-checking (visual inspection of formatting, chart rendering, correct client names and account numbers, cross-referencing with custodian statements). QA should cover a statistical sample at minimum; many firms review all reports for households above a materiality threshold.

4. **Compliance review (T+9 to T+10):** Compliance reviews a sample of reports to verify disclaimers are present and current, performance presentation is accurate and not misleading, benchmark descriptions are complete, and fee disclosures are appropriate. Any reports used for marketing purposes (e.g., shared with prospects) trigger additional review under the SEC Marketing Rule.

5. **Advisor review and commentary (T+8 to T+11):** Advisors review reports for their client relationships, add personalized commentary where applicable, and flag any issues (data they know to be incorrect, clients with special circumstances requiring modified reports). This stage often runs in parallel with compliance review.

6. **Approval and release (T+11 to T+12):** Final approval, either by a designated operations manager, the Chief Compliance Officer, or through an automated workflow, clears reports for delivery. Once approved, reports are locked against further editing.

7. **Delivery (T+12 to T+15):** Reports are published to the client portal, email notifications are sent, and print reports are dispatched. Delivery may be staggered (largest clients first, or by advisor team) to manage volume and catch any last-minute issues before the full batch goes out.

**Handling exceptions:**

- Accounts with unresolved data issues receive delayed reports with a communication to the client explaining the delay.
- New accounts with short history (less than one full quarter) may receive a modified report or a welcome package in lieu of a performance report.
- Closed accounts require a final report covering the period from the last report through the closing date, including final performance and distribution details.

**Timeline management:**

The reporting cycle compresses many dependencies into a tight window. Bottleneck identification is essential: late custodian data, slow reconciliation, advisor commentary delays, and compliance review capacity are the most common constraints. Firms should establish clear deadlines for each stage with escalation procedures when deadlines slip.

### Client Portal Integration

The client portal has become central to the reporting strategy, serving as both a delivery channel and an interactive extension of the static report.

**Report access models:**

- **Batch-published reports:** Traditional PDF reports generated quarterly and published to the portal on a scheduled date. Clients access them like a digital filing cabinet.
- **On-demand reports:** Clients can generate reports for custom date ranges or specific accounts directly through the portal, without waiting for the quarterly cycle.
- **Interactive dashboards:** Real-time or near-real-time portfolio views that complement static reports. Dashboards show current allocation, performance, holdings, and transactions with drill-down capability.

The most effective portal strategy combines all three: periodic batch reports for the formal record, on-demand capability for ad-hoc needs, and interactive dashboards for day-to-day engagement.

**Portal features that complement reports:**

- **Real-time portfolio view** — Current holdings, values, and allocation without waiting for the next report cycle.
- **Transaction history** — Searchable history of all transactions across accounts.
- **Document vault** — Secure storage for financial plans, tax documents, estate documents, and other sensitive files shared between advisor and client.
- **Secure messaging** — Encrypted communication channel between client and advisor, replacing unsecured email for sensitive topics.
- **Goal tracking** — Visual progress toward financial plan goals (retirement funded percentage, education savings target, etc.) that contextualizes portfolio performance.
- **Fee transparency** — Itemized fee history and current fee schedule accessible through the portal.

**Driving portal adoption:**

Many firms struggle with portal adoption rates, which typically range from 40% to 70% of clients actively using the portal. Strategies to improve adoption include making the portal the default delivery channel, demonstrating the portal during client meetings, simplifying the registration process (single sign-on, mobile-friendly), providing portal training materials, and emphasizing features beyond report access (document vault, secure messaging, goal tracking). Younger clients and those with larger portfolios tend to have higher adoption rates.

**Portal vendors:**

Leading platforms include Orion Connect (integrated with Orion PMS, strong reporting and planning integration), Black Diamond Client Experience (known for visual report quality and client experience), Tamarac Reporting (integrated with Envestnet ecosystem), Addepar Client Portal (favored by UHNW and family office firms for advanced analytics), and custom-built portals (used by larger firms wanting full control over the client experience). Selection criteria include integration with the firm's PMS, report customization capability, mobile experience, security features, and total cost of ownership.

### Tax Reporting and Year-End Deliverables

Tax reporting is a distinct reporting function with its own timeline, data requirements, and audience (the client's CPA or tax preparer in addition to the client).

**Tax-related reports:**

- **Realized gain/loss report** — Lists all securities sold during the tax year with purchase date, sale date, proceeds, cost basis, and gain or loss. Categorized by short-term vs long-term. This is the primary report used for tax return preparation. Must reconcile to the custodian's 1099-B.
- **Unrealized gain/loss report** — Shows the embedded gains and losses in current holdings as of year-end. Critical for year-end tax planning: identifying positions to sell for tax-loss harvesting or gain realization before year-end.
- **1099 supplement** — A reconciliation document explaining any differences between the custodian-issued 1099 and the firm's records. Differences commonly arise from amortization methods, return of capital classification, or wash sale adjustments.
- **Cost basis report** — Detailed tax lot information for all current holdings, showing original purchase date, acquisition cost, adjustments (wash sales, corporate actions, return of capital), and current tax basis.
- **Wash sale report** — Identifies wash sale events where losses were disallowed due to repurchase of substantially identical securities within the 30-day window before or after the sale.
- **Tax-loss harvesting summary** — For firms that actively harvest tax losses, a summary of harvesting activity during the year: losses harvested, replacement securities purchased, estimated tax benefit.

**Year-end deliverables beyond tax reports:**

- **Annual performance summary** — Full-year performance across all standard periods, often presented in a more polished format than the Q4 report.
- **Annual fee summary** — Total fees paid during the calendar year, useful for tax deduction purposes where applicable and for client awareness of total cost.
- **Year-end portfolio appraisal** — Complete holdings listing with market values as of December 31, often used as a reference point for estate planning, insurance reviews, and net worth statements.

**Timing and coordination:**

Tax reporting follows a distinct timeline from performance reporting. Preliminary tax reports are typically available in January, based on the best available data. However, custodians issue corrected 1099s through February and sometimes into March (particularly for accounts holding partnerships, REITs, or international securities). Final tax reports should be issued only after the custodian's 1099 correction period closes. Firms should communicate the timeline clearly to clients and their CPAs to avoid filing with preliminary data that later changes.

Coordination with client CPAs is a value-added service. Proactive firms send tax reports directly to the client's CPA (with client authorization), provide a cover letter explaining the reports and any notable items, and make themselves available to answer CPA questions during tax season. This reduces friction for the client and positions the advisor as a hub of the client's financial team.

### Compliance Requirements for Client Reports

Client reports are communications to clients and therefore subject to regulatory scrutiny. Compliance requirements vary based on the firm's registration type (RIA, broker-dealer, dual registrant) and how the reports are used.

**Regulatory framework:**

- **SEC Marketing Rule (Rule 206(4)-1):** If client reports or performance extracts are shared with prospective clients, they become advertisements subject to the Marketing Rule. This includes requirements for performance presentation (net returns, one/five/ten year periods, prominent disclosure), prohibitions on misleading statements, and compliance review and approval before use.
- **FINRA Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public):** For broker-dealers, client reports are "correspondence" (communication with up to 25 retail investors in 30 days) or "retail communication" (more than 25). Retail communications require principal pre-approval; correspondence requires supervisory procedures. All communications must be fair, balanced, and not misleading.
- **SEC Custody Rule:** Reports may create "custody" implications if the firm has the ability to deduct fees directly. Fee disclosures in reports should be consistent with the firm's custody rule compliance.
- **Regulation S-P (Privacy):** Reports contain non-public personal information and must be delivered securely. Delivery methods (email, portal, mail) must comply with the firm's privacy policies and procedures.

**Required disclaimers:**

- Past performance is not indicative of future results.
- Description of each benchmark used, including that the benchmark is not investable and does not reflect fees or expenses.
- Whether returns are presented net or gross of advisory fees, and the impact of fees on returns.
- Firm registration information (RIA registration with the SEC or state, FINRA membership if applicable).
- Material facts necessary to avoid misleading the client (e.g., strategy changes, benchmark changes, calculation methodology changes).

**Supervisory review:**

Firms must establish supervisory procedures for client report review. The scope of supervisory review typically includes verifying performance accuracy (sampling), confirming disclaimers are present and current, reviewing advisor-written commentary for compliance (no guarantees, no promissory language, fair and balanced), and checking that reports are consistent with the client's actual account and investment strategy. Compliance should document the review process, the reviewer, the date, and any issues identified and resolved.

**Record retention:**

Under the SEC's books-and-records rules (Rule 204-2 for RIAs, Rule 17a-4 for broker-dealers), firms must retain copies of all communications delivered to clients, including client reports. Retention periods are typically five years (RIAs) or six years (broker-dealers) from the date of delivery. The retained copy must be the exact version delivered to the client. Digital archiving of PDFs published to portals satisfies this requirement when properly indexed and backed up.

**GIPS requirements:**

Firms claiming GIPS compliance must present composite-level performance in GIPS-compliant reports to prospective clients. Individual client reports are not composites, but the firm should ensure that client-level performance data does not contradict composite presentations and that GIPS-required disclosures appear on any report used to market the firm's investment capabilities.

### Report Quality Assurance

Quality assurance is the safeguard between report generation and client delivery. Errors in client reports damage credibility, create compliance risk, and generate costly re-issuance work.

**Automated validation checks:**

- **Return reasonableness:** Period returns for each account and the household fall within expected ranges (e.g., equity-heavy portfolios during a quarter when the S&P 500 returned 5% should show returns in a reasonable band around that figure). Flag outliers for manual review.
- **AUM reconciliation:** Total market value on the report matches the PMS balance and is within tolerance of the custodian statement balance. Differences exceeding a threshold (e.g., 0.1%) trigger investigation.
- **Fee calculation validation:** Advisory fees shown on the report match the billing system records. Fee rates match the client's fee schedule.
- **Completeness checks:** No missing data fields (blank returns, zero AUM for active accounts, missing benchmark data, absent disclaimers). All accounts in the household are included.
- **Period consistency:** The reporting period is correct (e.g., the Q4 report covers October 1 through December 31, not a different range).

**Visual and manual inspection:**

- **Formatting:** Charts render correctly, tables are properly aligned, page breaks fall at logical points, fonts and colors are consistent with the template.
- **Client-specific accuracy:** The correct client name, account numbers, and advisor name appear on the report. Reports are not crossed (Client A receiving Client B's data).
- **Data cross-check:** Spot-check report data against the PMS and custodian statement for a sample of accounts. Verify that holdings, transactions, and performance are consistent across sources.

**Common errors and root causes:**

- **Stale data:** Reports generated before custodian reconciliation is complete, reflecting outdated positions or missing transactions.
- **Incorrect benchmark:** A benchmark assignment error in the PMS causes the wrong benchmark to appear on the report, making performance comparison meaningless.
- **Wrong time period:** A configuration error causes reports to display incorrect period dates or returns for the wrong quarter.
- **Formatting glitches:** Template updates that break chart rendering, cause text overflow, or misalign columns.
- **Missing accounts:** An account recently added to the household is excluded from the consolidated report because the PMS grouping was not updated.
- **Cross-client errors:** The most severe error type — delivering a report containing another client's data. This is both a compliance violation and a privacy breach requiring notification.

**Error tracking and resolution:**

Firms should maintain an error log tracking each identified issue: date discovered, report affected, error type, root cause, resolution, and corrective action to prevent recurrence. Error rate metrics (errors per 1,000 reports generated) should be tracked over time and reported to management. A rising error rate signals a systemic issue (data quality, template instability, staffing) requiring intervention.

**Client-reported errors:**

When a client identifies an error, the resolution workflow includes acknowledgment (prompt response to the client), investigation (verify the error and identify the cause), correction (generate a corrected report), re-issuance (deliver the corrected report with a brief explanation), and root cause analysis (determine whether the error is isolated or systemic). The tone of client communication should be transparent and professional, treating the error seriously while reassuring the client that their actual account and investments are unaffected if the error is limited to the report.

## Worked Examples

See [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for three end-to-end worked examples — redesigning a quarterly reporting package with tiered templates, transitioning from print to digital-first delivery, and remediating performance calculation errors in delivered reports. Load it when the user needs a full scenario walkthrough.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Generating reports before data is final.** Rushing to meet a delivery deadline with preliminary data — particularly for alternative investments, international securities, or accounts with pending corporate actions — leads to inaccurate reports and costly re-issuance. Establish a data readiness gate that must pass before report generation begins.

- **One-size-fits-all report design.** Delivering the same 25-page report to every client regardless of portfolio size, complexity, or sophistication wastes the client's time and the firm's resources. Tier-based customization ensures each client receives an appropriately scoped report.

- **Neglecting the performance disclaimer.** Omitting or using outdated performance disclaimers creates compliance risk. Disclaimers must be reviewed and updated at least annually by compliance, covering past performance language, benchmark descriptions, fee impact, and calculation methodology.

- **Ignoring delivery preferences.** Forcing all clients to digital delivery or continuing to print for clients who prefer digital wastes resources and frustrates clients. Maintain an accurate delivery preference database and honor stated preferences.

- **Presenting annualized returns for periods under one year.** Annualizing a three-month return inflates the apparent performance and is misleading. Only annualize returns for periods exceeding one year, and clearly label all return periods.

- **Failing to reconcile advisor reports to custodian statements.** When clients notice discrepancies between the advisor's report and the custodian statement, they lose confidence in the advisor's data. Proactively explain common differences (timing, methodology, household consolidation) and ensure the report includes a note about the relationship between the two.

- **Treating the report as a standalone document rather than a conversation tool.** Reports are most valuable when reviewed with the client, not simply mailed. Advisors who use reports as a framework for client meetings extract significantly more relationship value from the reporting investment.

- **Underinvesting in quality assurance.** Skipping or minimizing QA to speed delivery is a false economy. A single cross-client error (delivering Client A's data to Client B) creates a privacy breach, compliance violation, and severe reputational damage that far exceeds the cost of thorough QA.

- **Not tracking portal adoption metrics.** Launching a client portal without measuring adoption leads to low usage and wasted technology investment. Set specific adoption targets and actively manage the onboarding funnel.

- **Delaying tax report delivery without client communication.** Clients and their CPAs expect tax reports by a certain date. When corrected 1099s delay final tax reporting, proactive communication about the timeline prevents frustration and demonstrates professionalism.
