# Operational Risk

## Core Concepts

### Operational Risk Framework
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. The Basel Committee's seven event-type categories map to trading operations as follows:

| Basel event type | Trading-operations examples |
|---|---|
| 1. Internal fraud | Unauthorized trading, intentional position mismarking, fictitious trade booking, front-running |
| 2. External fraud | Account takeover, phishing for trade credentials, wire fraud in settlement instructions, counterparty manipulation |
| 3. Employment practices and workplace safety | Inadequate operations training, key-person dependency, error-inducing workload |
| 4. Clients, products, and business practices | Suitability failures, improper execution, best execution violations, failure to follow client instructions |
| 5. Damage to physical assets | Data center or trading floor damage from natural disasters or civil disruption |
| 6. Business disruption and system failures | OMS outages, market data feed failures, connectivity loss, exchange gateway and clearing system downtime |
| 7. Execution, delivery, and process management | Trade errors, settlement fails, reconciliation breaks, failed corporate action processing, incorrect margin calculations (typically the largest loss category) |

**Risk identification** involves cataloging all operational risk exposures through process mapping, risk and control self-assessments (RCSAs), loss event analysis, scenario analysis, and audit findings. **Risk assessment** scores each risk on likelihood and impact dimensions, typically using a 5x5 heat map. **Risk monitoring** tracks KRIs, loss events, and control effectiveness. **Risk mitigation** applies controls (preventive and detective), process redesign, technology solutions, insurance, and business continuity planning.

### Trade Errors
A trade error occurs when a transaction is executed incorrectly due to human mistake, system malfunction, or miscommunication. Common trade error types include:

- **Wrong security.** The wrong CUSIP, ISIN, or ticker is entered, resulting in a purchase or sale of an unintended security. Often caused by similar ticker symbols (e.g., entering "AAPL" instead of "APLE") or selecting the wrong line item from a dropdown.
- **Wrong quantity.** The number of shares, bonds, or contracts is incorrect. A frequent subcategory is the "fat finger" error where an extra digit is entered (e.g., 10,000 shares instead of 1,000).
- **Wrong side.** A buy is entered as a sell, or vice versa, resulting in a position that is the opposite of intended. The net exposure error is twice the intended trade size.
- **Wrong account.** The trade is executed in the wrong client account or in the firm's proprietary account instead of a client account. This creates suitability, allocation, and potential conflict-of-interest issues.
- **Duplicate orders.** The same order is submitted more than once due to system timeout and resubmission, double-clicking, or failure of deduplication logic. The firm ends up with twice the intended position.
- **Wrong price type or limit.** A market order is placed instead of a limit order, or the limit price is set incorrectly, resulting in execution at an unintended price.
- **Stale or cancelled order execution.** An order that should have been cancelled is executed because the cancellation was not processed in time or was lost in transit.

**Error detection methods.** Errors are detected through: real-time position monitoring (unexpected position changes trigger alerts), pre-trade validation rules (quantity limits, security restrictions, account eligibility checks), post-trade reconciliation (comparing expected vs. actual positions), client complaints, clearing firm or counterparty rejection notices, and P&L attribution (unexplained P&L often signals an error).

**Error correction procedures.** Once detected, errors must be corrected promptly:

- **Cancel and rebook.** The erroneous trade is cancelled and the correct trade is booked. If the error is caught before settlement, the cancel/rebook may occur on the same trade date. If caught after settlement, an as-of trade is used to adjust the position retroactively.
- **Error account.** Most broker-dealers maintain one or more error accounts (also called difference accounts) where erroneous trades are transferred pending resolution. The error account isolates the incorrect position from client accounts and tracks the resulting P&L. Error account activity is subject to supervisory review and must be documented.
- **Error P&L allocation.** Losses from trade errors are absorbed by the firm and may not be passed to clients. Gains from trade errors present a more nuanced situation — regulatory guidance and firm policy dictate whether the gain reverts to the client's account or remains in the error account. FINRA has stated that firms should not systematically benefit from trade errors at clients' expense.
- **Root cause analysis.** Every trade error should trigger a root cause analysis to determine whether the error was caused by a process deficiency, a technology issue, inadequate training, or an individual's mistake. Root cause findings feed into the operational risk framework's risk identification and mitigation cycle.

### Trade Breaks and Reconciliation
A trade break occurs when two records of the same transaction do not match. Breaks arise at multiple points in the trade lifecycle:

- **Front-to-back breaks.** The order management system (OMS) record does not match the execution management system (EMS) fill, or the trade record in the front-office system does not match the middle-office booking. Causes include partial fills that are not properly aggregated, manual booking errors, and system integration failures.
- **Firm-to-counterparty breaks.** The firm's trade record does not match the counterparty's record. Detected through trade matching and confirmation processes (e.g., DTCC CTM, Omgeo, SWIFT matching). Common causes are quantity discrepancies, price differences (especially for OTC trades with negotiated prices), settlement date mismatches, and incorrect settlement instruction details (SSI mismatches).
- **Firm-to-custodian breaks.** The firm's position records do not match the custodian's records. Detected through daily or intra-day position reconciliation. Causes include unbooked trades, corporate action processing differences, failed settlements not reflected in one system, and timing differences in trade date vs. settlement date accounting.
- **Cash breaks.** The firm's cash ledger does not match the bank or custodian's cash statement. Causes include unbooked cash movements, fee deductions not recorded, interest accrual differences, and foreign exchange conversion discrepancies.

**Reconciliation process.** Firms conduct three primary types of reconciliation:

1. **Position reconciliation.** Compares the firm's securities positions to the custodian's, clearing firm's, or depository's records. Performed daily for actively traded accounts.
2. **Transaction reconciliation.** Matches individual transactions between the firm's records and external records (counterparty confirmations, clearing statements, custodian statements). Ensures every trade is captured in both systems.
3. **Cash reconciliation.** Compares the firm's cash balances and movements to bank and custodian statements. Identifies unrecorded debits, credits, or fee charges.

**Break resolution workflow.** A typical break resolution process includes: (1) automated matching to clear breaks that are within tolerance thresholds (e.g., price differences under $0.01, quantity differences due to rounding); (2) assignment of unresolved breaks to operations analysts; (3) investigation to identify the root cause; (4) correction of the erroneous record in the appropriate system; (5) confirmation with the counterparty or custodian that the break is resolved; (6) documentation of the resolution and root cause.

**Aging and escalation.** Unresolved breaks are tracked by age. Industry standards and regulatory expectations require escalation based on aging thresholds:

| Age | Status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| T+0 to T+1 | Normal | Investigate and resolve in the ordinary course |
| T+2 to T+3 | Attention | Escalate to senior operations staff; increase priority |
| T+4 to T+5 | Warning | Escalate to operations management; engage counterparty directly |
| T+5+ | Critical | Escalate to head of operations and compliance; assess financial exposure |

**Tolerance thresholds.** Firms establish tolerance levels below which breaks are auto-resolved. Common thresholds: price tolerance of +/- $0.01 per unit for exchange-traded securities, quantity tolerance of +/- 1 unit for rounding differences, and cash tolerance of +/- $1.00 for minor rounding. Tolerances must be reviewed periodically and should not be set so wide as to mask genuine errors.

### Loss Event Management
Loss events are actual losses resulting from operational risk incidents. Effective loss event management requires:

**Loss event identification.** Sources include trade error P&L, settlement fail charges (buy-in costs, overdraft interest), regulatory fines and penalties, litigation settlements, system outage costs (missed trades, manual processing costs), and compensation payments to clients for service failures.

**Loss event classification.** Each loss event is classified by:

- **Basel event type** (one of the seven categories above)
- **Business line** (trading desk, operations, technology, compliance)
- **Causal category** (people, process, system, external)
- **Severity** (minor, moderate, significant, major, critical — based on dollar thresholds established by the firm)

**Loss event documentation.** Each event record should include: date of occurrence, date of discovery, date of resolution, description of the event, root cause, Basel category, business line, gross loss amount, recoveries (insurance, counterparty reimbursement), net loss amount, corrective actions taken, and responsible manager.

**Near-miss tracking.** Events that could have resulted in a loss but did not (due to timely detection or favorable market movement) are tracked as near-misses. Near-misses are leading indicators of control weaknesses and are analyzed alongside actual losses. Example: a fat finger error that was caught by a pre-trade quantity limit before execution is a near-miss.

**Loss event database.** Firms maintain an internal loss event database (often part of a GRC — Governance, Risk, and Compliance — platform) that aggregates all loss events across the organization. The database enables trend analysis, root cause pattern identification, and reporting to senior management and the board.

**Threshold reporting.** Firms establish reporting thresholds:

| Threshold | Action |
|---|---|
| > $10,000 | Report to department head within 24 hours |
| > $50,000 | Report to Chief Risk Officer within 24 hours |
| > $100,000 | Report to senior management and Risk Committee |
| > $500,000 | Board notification; assess regulatory reporting obligations |

These thresholds are illustrative; each firm calibrates to its size, complexity, and risk appetite.

**Regulatory notification.** Certain loss events trigger regulatory reporting obligations. FINRA Rule 4530 requires member firms to report specified events, including significant operational incidents. SEC Rule 17a-11 requires broker-dealers to notify the SEC of certain financial and operational conditions. Firms must maintain a matrix mapping loss event types and thresholds to applicable regulatory notification requirements.

### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
KRIs are metrics that provide early warning of increasing operational risk exposure. They are distinguished from key performance indicators (KPIs) in that KRIs are specifically designed to signal risk rather than measure performance, though some metrics serve both purposes.

**Leading vs. lagging indicators.** Leading indicators predict future risk events (e.g., rising system latency may predict an outage). Lagging indicators measure events that have already occurred (e.g., number of trade errors last month). An effective KRI program includes both types.

**Common trading operations KRIs:**

| KRI | Definition | Leading/Lagging |
|---|---|---|
| NIGO rate | Not-In-Good-Order rate: percentage of trade instructions received with missing or incorrect information | Leading |
| Trade break rate | Number of unmatched trades as a percentage of total trades | Lagging |
| Settlement fail rate | Number of failed settlements as a percentage of total settlements | Lagging |
| Trade error rate | Number of trade errors per 1,000 trades executed | Lagging |
| Error account balance | Aggregate dollar value of positions in error accounts | Lagging |
| STP rate | Straight-Through Processing rate: percentage of trades processed without manual intervention | Leading |
| System availability | Uptime percentage of critical trading and operations systems | Leading |
| Margin call volume | Number and dollar value of margin calls issued or received | Leading |
| Aged break count | Number of trade breaks older than the escalation threshold | Leading |
| Cancel/correct ratio | Number of trade cancellations and corrections as a percentage of total trades | Lagging |
| Reconciliation completion rate | Percentage of daily reconciliations completed by the target deadline | Leading |
| Open incident count | Number of unresolved operational incidents | Leading |

**KRI thresholds.** Each KRI is assigned threshold levels using a traffic-light model:

- **Green.** Within normal operating range. No action required beyond routine monitoring.
- **Amber.** Approaching risk tolerance. Triggers enhanced monitoring, investigation, and may require management attention. Root cause analysis begins.
- **Red.** Exceeds risk tolerance. Requires immediate management action, escalation to senior management or risk committee, and a documented remediation plan with target dates.

**Example threshold calibration for trade break rate:**

| Level | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Green | < 2% of daily trade volume | Routine monitoring |
| Amber | 2% - 5% of daily trade volume | Investigate root cause; increase reconciliation frequency |
| Red | > 5% of daily trade volume | Escalate to Head of Operations; halt new activity if warranted |

**KRI trending and reporting.** KRIs are tracked over time to identify trends. A KRI that remains in the green zone but is trending upward toward amber is more informative than a snapshot reading. Monthly KRI reports to management should include current values, threshold status, trend direction, and commentary on any amber or red indicators.

### Incident Management
Operational incidents in trading operations range from minor system glitches to major outages that affect market participation. A structured incident management process ensures consistent response and resolution.

**Incident classification (severity levels):**

| Severity | Definition | Examples | Response Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEV-1 (Critical) | Complete loss of trading capability or significant financial exposure | Order management system down; inability to route orders to any exchange; clearing system failure preventing settlement | Immediate; all-hands response |
| SEV-2 (Major) | Significant degradation of trading capability or material financial risk | Market data feed failure for a major exchange; inability to process a specific order type; partial connectivity loss | Within 15 minutes |
| SEV-3 (Moderate) | Limited impact on trading operations; workaround available | Slow system performance; failure of a non-critical reporting function; single counterparty connectivity issue | Within 1 hour |
| SEV-4 (Minor) | Minimal operational impact; no financial exposure | Cosmetic UI issues; non-urgent report delays; minor data quality issues with no trade impact | Within 4 hours |

**Incident response procedures.** A standard incident lifecycle includes:

1. **Detection and reporting.** Incidents are detected through monitoring alerts, user reports, counterparty notifications, or automated health checks.
2. **Triage and classification.** The incident is assessed for severity, scope, and potential financial impact. A severity level is assigned.
3. **Communication.** Stakeholders are notified according to the communication protocol. For SEV-1 and SEV-2, this includes trading desk heads, operations management, technology leadership, compliance, and senior management. A designated incident commander coordinates the response.
4. **Containment.** Immediate actions to prevent the incident from expanding. This may include halting automated trading, switching to manual order entry, activating backup systems, or notifying exchanges and counterparties.
5. **Resolution.** Technical teams work to restore normal operations. For system outages, this involves failover to backup systems, restarting services, or deploying emergency patches.
6. **Recovery.** After the root cause is addressed, normal operations resume. Outstanding orders, trades, and positions are reconciled. Any trades missed during the outage are evaluated for client impact.
7. **Post-incident review.** A formal review is conducted to document root cause, timeline, impact, response effectiveness, and corrective actions.

**Escalation matrix.** The escalation path is defined by severity level:

- SEV-1: Incident Commander, CTO/COO, Head of Trading, Chief Risk Officer, CEO (if market-wide impact)
- SEV-2: Incident Commander, VP of Technology, Head of Trading Operations, Chief Risk Officer
- SEV-3: Technology team lead, Operations manager
- SEV-4: Individual contributor, supervisor

**Root cause analysis techniques.** Two widely used methods:

- **5 Whys.** Iteratively ask "why" until the root cause is identified. Example: Why did the trade error occur? Because the wrong account was selected. Why? Because the account dropdown displayed similar names. Why? Because the UI does not show account numbers alongside names. Why? Because the account display format was never updated after the firm acquired new clients. Root cause: inadequate UI design compounded by post-acquisition system integration gaps.
- **Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram.** Categorizes potential causes into six branches: People, Process, Technology, Data, Environment, and External. Each branch is explored to identify contributing factors.

**Corrective action tracking.** Every root cause analysis produces corrective actions. Each action is assigned an owner, a target completion date, and a status (open, in progress, completed, verified). A corrective action register is maintained and reviewed at regular operational risk meetings. Corrective actions are not considered closed until they have been independently verified as effective.

### Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery
Trading operations must maintain the ability to continue critical functions during disruptive events. Regulatory requirements (including FINRA Rule 4370) mandate business continuity planning for broker-dealers.

**FINRA Rule 4370 (Business Continuity Plans and Emergency Contact Information).** Every FINRA member must create and maintain a written business continuity plan (BCP) that addresses, at a minimum: data backup and recovery, all mission-critical systems, financial and operational assessments, alternate communications with customers and regulators, alternate physical location, critical business constituent impact, regulatory reporting, and communications with regulators. The plan must be updated in the event of any material change to the firm's operations, structure, business, or location.

**Recovery Time Objective (RTO).** The maximum acceptable duration of a system outage before the business impact becomes unacceptable. For trading operations, RTOs are typically measured in minutes to hours:

| System | Typical RTO |
|---|---|
| Order management system | < 30 minutes |
| Market data feeds | < 15 minutes |
| Exchange connectivity | < 15 minutes |
| Risk management system | < 1 hour |
| Settlement/clearing interface | < 2 hours |
| Client reporting systems | < 4 hours |

**Recovery Point Objective (RPO).** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. An RPO of 5 minutes means the firm can tolerate losing at most 5 minutes of transaction data. For trading systems, RPOs are typically near-zero (synchronous replication) for order and execution data, and minutes for less critical data.

**Failover procedures.** Critical systems should have automated or semi-automated failover to secondary environments. This includes: active-passive database replication with automated promotion of the standby, redundant network paths to exchanges and clearing firms, geographically separated data centers, and pre-configured disaster recovery trading environments.

**Remote trading capabilities.** Firms must ensure that traders and operations staff can operate from alternate locations. This includes: VPN access to trading systems, pre-provisioned remote trading workstations, tested voice communication (trading turrets, recorded phone lines) from remote locations, and documented procedures for activating remote trading.

**Communication plans.** During a disruption, the firm must communicate with: clients (regarding order status, account access, and alternate contact methods), regulators (FINRA, SEC, exchanges), counterparties and clearing firms, employees, and critical vendors. Contact trees and communication templates should be pre-established and tested.

**Testing requirements.** FINRA Rule 4370 requires that BCPs be reviewed and tested at least annually. Industry best practice includes: tabletop exercises (walkthrough of scenarios), functional testing of backup systems and failover, full-scale simulation exercises, and third-party testing with exchanges and clearing firms. Test results should be documented and deficiencies addressed through corrective actions.

### Technology Risk
Technology risk is a subset of operational risk that is particularly acute in trading operations due to the dependence on automated systems for order routing, execution, risk management, and settlement processing.

**System reliability.** Trading systems must meet high availability standards. Common targets are 99.95% uptime (approximately 4.4 hours of allowable downtime per year) for mission-critical systems. Reliability is achieved through redundant architecture, automated monitoring, capacity planning, and regular performance testing.

**Change management.** Software and configuration changes to trading systems are a leading source of operational incidents. A disciplined change management process includes: change request documentation, impact assessment, testing in non-production environments, scheduled deployment windows (avoiding market hours for high-risk changes), rollback procedures, and post-deployment verification. Emergency changes during market hours require expedited approval with heightened risk awareness.

**Vendor risk management.** Trading operations depend on numerous third-party vendors for market data, order routing, clearing, settlement, and technology infrastructure. Vendor risk management includes: due diligence before onboarding, service level agreements (SLAs) with measurable performance standards, ongoing monitoring of vendor performance and financial health, contingency plans for vendor failure, and concentration risk assessment (avoiding excessive dependence on a single vendor for critical functions).

**Cybersecurity in trading systems.** Trading systems are high-value targets for cyberattack. Key cybersecurity controls include: network segmentation to isolate trading systems, multi-factor authentication for system access, encryption of data in transit and at rest, intrusion detection and prevention systems, regular penetration testing, and incident response plans specific to cyber events.

**Market data system failures.** Loss of market data (prices, quotes, reference data) can prevent accurate order pricing, risk calculation, and compliance checking. Firms should maintain: redundant market data feeds from multiple vendors, fallback pricing mechanisms (last known price, manual price entry with controls), and alerts for stale or missing data. Market data failures that affect order routing or execution quality should be classified and managed as operational incidents.

**Order routing system failures.** Inability to route orders to exchanges or market centers is a SEV-1 incident for a trading operation. Controls include: redundant FIX connections to each execution venue, alternative order routing paths, manual order entry capabilities at exchange terminals as a last resort, and pre-established procedures for notifying clients of execution delays.

## Worked Examples

Three worked examples are in [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) — load for an end-to-end scenario: (1) building an operational risk framework for a broker-dealer's trading desks, (2) designing a standardized trade error handling and correction process, (3) implementing a KRI dashboard for trading operations management.

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating operational risk management as a compliance exercise rather than a business management discipline — forms are completed but risks are not actively managed or mitigated.
- Failing to track near-misses alongside actual losses, thereby missing early warning signals of deteriorating controls.
- Setting KRI thresholds based on aspiration rather than data — thresholds that are perpetually in the red lose credibility and are ignored by management.
- Allowing trade error corrections without documentation, creating invisible risk exposure and preventing root cause analysis.
- Under-investing in reconciliation processes — aged breaks are a leading indicator of operational failures and potential financial losses, yet break resolution is often deprioritized relative to new trade processing.
- Relying solely on end-of-day reconciliation when intra-day position monitoring would detect errors hours earlier and reduce the P&L impact.
- Conducting business continuity plan testing as a check-the-box exercise without realistic scenarios, thereby failing to identify actual recovery gaps.
- Ignoring technology change management as a source of operational risk — a disproportionate share of major incidents originates from software deployments and configuration changes.
- Failing to establish clear escalation matrices, resulting in ad hoc responses to incidents that vary depending on who happens to be on duty.
- Classifying all operational risk events under a single category rather than using the Basel taxonomy, which prevents meaningful trend analysis and benchmarking.
- Overlooking vendor concentration risk — a single vendor failure affecting market data, order routing, or clearing can be a firm-wide operational risk event.
- Not closing the loop on corrective actions — root cause analyses produce recommendations, but without tracking and verification, the same failures recur.

## Cross-References
- **order-lifecycle** (trading-operations): The order lifecycle from order entry through execution is where many operational risk events originate; error detection and prevention are embedded at each stage.
- **settlement-clearing** (trading-operations): Settlement fails and clearing breaks are a primary operational risk category; settlement fail management processes are closely linked to the operational risk framework.
- **counterparty-risk** (trading-operations): Counterparty failures (failure to deliver securities or pay cash) are an external operational risk that intersects with credit risk management.
- **trade-execution** (trading-operations): Execution quality failures, routing errors, and best execution violations are operational risk events with regulatory implications.
- **pre-trade-compliance** (trading-operations): Pre-trade checks serve as preventive controls against trade errors, unauthorized trading, and account restriction violations.
- **post-trade-compliance** (trading-operations): Post-trade surveillance detects errors and anomalies that escaped pre-trade controls.
- **books-and-records** (compliance): Loss event documentation, incident records, and error account activity are regulatory books and records subject to retention requirements.
- **examination-readiness** (compliance): Operational risk frameworks, incident logs, and BCP documentation are common examination topics for FINRA and SEC examiners.
- **privacy-data-security** (compliance): Cybersecurity incidents affecting trading systems are operational risk events that also trigger data protection and breach notification obligations.
