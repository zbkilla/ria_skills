# Lending Analysis

## Core Concepts

### Fixed-Rate Mortgage
The interest rate and monthly payment remain constant for the life of the loan:

- **Advantages:** Predictable payments, protection against rising rates, simpler budgeting
- **Disadvantages:** Higher initial rate than ARM, no benefit if rates decline (must refinance)
- Most common terms: 30-year and 15-year fixed

### Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)
Rate is fixed for an initial period, then adjusts periodically based on an index plus a margin:

- **Notation:** 5/1 ARM = fixed for 5 years, adjusts annually thereafter; 7/1, 10/1 similarly
- **Fully indexed rate:** Index (e.g., SOFR, 1-year Treasury) + margin (e.g., 2.75%)
- **Rate caps** protect against extreme adjustments:
  - Initial adjustment cap (e.g., 2%): maximum first adjustment
  - Periodic cap (e.g., 2%): maximum change per adjustment period
  - Lifetime cap (e.g., 5%): maximum total increase over initial rate
- **When ARM may be appropriate:** Planning to sell or refinance before the fixed period ends, expecting rates to decline, or comfortable with rate variability

### Monthly Payment Calculation
The standard amortization formula for a fixed-rate loan:

- PMT = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
- Where: P = principal (loan amount), r = monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12), n = total number of payments (term in months)
- Each payment splits into interest (decreasing) and principal (increasing) components:
  - Interest portion: remaining balance × monthly rate
  - Principal portion: PMT - interest portion

### Total Interest Paid
- Total interest = (n × PMT) - P
- For a $400K, 30-year loan at 6.5%: PMT = $2,528, total payments = $910,178, total interest = $510,178

### Extra Payments
Additional principal payments reduce the outstanding balance, shorten the loan term, and reduce total interest:

- Each extra dollar goes entirely to principal reduction
- Impact compounds: earlier extra payments save more interest than later ones
- Methods: lump sum, fixed monthly extra, biweekly payments (26 half-payments = 13 full payments per year)

### Mortgage Points
Prepaid interest that reduces the loan's interest rate:

- **1 point = 1% of the loan amount** (e.g., 1 point on $400K = $4,000)
- Typically reduces the rate by approximately 0.25% (varies by lender and market)
- **Breakeven calculation:** Points cost / monthly savings = months to recoup
- Points make sense when: planning to hold the loan beyond breakeven, itemizing deductions (points may be tax-deductible in year of purchase)

### APR vs Interest Rate
- **Interest rate:** The cost of borrowing the principal, expressed annually
- **APR (Annual Percentage Rate):** Includes the interest rate plus certain fees and costs (origination fees, points, PMI), annualized over the loan term
- **APR > interest rate** (always, when there are fees)
- APR is the better metric for comparing loan offers with different fee structures

### HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit)
A revolving credit line secured by home equity:

- **Combined LTV (CLTV):** (First mortgage balance + HELOC limit) / home value
  - Most lenders require CLTV ≤ 80-90%
- **Draw period** (typically 10 years): borrow and repay flexibly, often interest-only payments
- **Repayment period** (typically 20 years): no new draws, fully amortizing payments
- **Variable rate:** Typically prime rate + margin; rate fluctuates with market
- **Use cases:** Home improvements, debt consolidation, emergency backup (but not as primary emergency fund)
- **Risk:** Home is collateral — default means foreclosure

### Loan Qualification Criteria
- **FICO score:** 620+ for conventional, 580+ for FHA, 700+ for best rates
- **DTI:** Front-end ≤ 28%, back-end ≤ 36-43% (varies by program)
- **LTV (Loan-to-Value):** Loan amount / property value; lower LTV = lower risk = better terms
- **Reserves:** Months of payments held in liquid assets after closing (2-6 months typical)
- **Employment/income:** Stable income history, typically 2 years documentation

### PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)
Required when conventional loan LTV exceeds 80%:

- **Cost:** 0.5-1.5% of loan amount annually, added to monthly payment
- **Removal:** Automatic at 78% LTV (based on original amortization), requestable at 80% LTV
- **Avoidance strategies:** 20% down payment, piggyback loan (80/10/10), lender-paid PMI (higher rate), VA loan (no PMI)
- PMI benefits the lender, not the borrower — it is pure cost to the borrower

### 15-Year vs 30-Year Comparison
- **15-year:** Higher monthly payment, lower interest rate (typically 0.5-0.75% less), dramatically less total interest, builds equity faster
- **30-year:** Lower required payment, more flexibility, higher total interest cost
- **Hybrid approach:** Take a 30-year for flexibility, make extra payments as if it were a 15-year

## Key Formulas

| Formula | Expression | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Monthly payment | PMT = P × [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1] | Fixed-rate loan payment |
| Total interest | n × PMT - P | Total cost of borrowing |
| Remaining balance after k payments | B_k = P × [(1+r)^n - (1+r)^k] / [(1+r)^n - 1] | Balance at any point |
| Points breakeven | Cost of points / monthly savings | Months to recoup points |
| LTV | Loan amount / property value | Risk and PMI assessment |
| CLTV | (First mortgage + HELOC) / home value | Combined leverage |
| ARM fully indexed rate | Index + margin | Rate after fixed period |

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: 30-year vs 15-year mortgage comparison
**Given:** Home price $500K, down payment $100K, loan amount $400K. 30-year rate: 6.5%. 15-year rate: 5.9%.
**Calculate:** Monthly payments, total interest, and interest savings.
**Solution:**
1. **30-year monthly payment:** PMT = $400,000 × [0.005417 × (1.005417)^360] / [(1.005417)^360 - 1]
   - r = 6.5%/12 = 0.005417, n = 360
   - PMT = **$2,528/month**
2. **30-year total interest:** 360 × $2,528 - $400,000 = **$510,178**
3. **15-year monthly payment:** PMT = $400,000 × [0.004917 × (1.004917)^180] / [(1.004917)^180 - 1]
   - r = 5.9%/12 = 0.004917, n = 180
   - PMT = **$3,354/month**
4. **15-year total interest:** 180 × $3,354 - $400,000 = **$203,694**
5. **Payment difference:** $3,354 - $2,528 = **$826/month more** for 15-year.
6. **Interest savings:** $510,178 - $203,694 = **$306,484 saved** by choosing 15-year.
7. The 15-year costs 33% more per month but saves 60% in total interest.

### Example 2: Extra payment impact
**Given:** $300K 30-year mortgage at 6.5% (payment = $1,896.20/month). Borrower adds $200/month extra to principal, making the total payment $2,096.20/month.
**Calculate:** Time saved and interest saved.
**Solution:**
1. **Without extra payments:** 360 months, total interest = 360 × $1,896.20 - $300,000 = **$382,633**.
2. **New term (closed-form estimate):** n = -ln(1 - P × r / PMT_total) / ln(1+r) with r = 0.065/12 = 0.005417:
   - n = -ln(1 - $300,000 × 0.005417 / $2,096.20) / ln(1.005417) ≈ 276.3 payments.
3. **Exact amortization** (month-by-month simulation, final payment partial): payoff in **277 months = 23 years 1 month** (~23.1 years), total interest = **$279,185**. The closed form and the exact schedule agree closely.
4. **Interest saved:** $382,633 - $279,185 = **$103,449**.
5. **Time saved:** 360 - 277 = 83 months ≈ **6.9 years**.
6. Total extra principal paid ≈ 276 × $200 = **$55,200**. Interest saved per dollar of extra payment: $103,449 / $55,200 ≈ **$1.87**.

## Common Pitfalls
- Comparing interest rate instead of APR — APR captures fees and gives a truer cost comparison
- ARM teaser rates creating payment shock when the fixed period ends and rates adjust upward
- Points breakeven: buying points is not worth it if selling or refinancing before the breakeven point
- HELOC variable rate risk during rising rate environments — budget for rate increases
- PMI costs making high-LTV loans more expensive than they appear — factor PMI into total monthly cost
- Ignoring opportunity cost: extra mortgage payments at 3-4% vs investing at 7-10% expected return
- Not shopping multiple lenders — rate quotes can vary 0.5%+ for the same borrower
- Resetting to a 30-year term when refinancing — extends total payoff even if rate is lower
- Ignoring closing costs in refinancing decisions (see debt-management refinance breakeven)

A bare run prints a demo covering payment calculation, extra-payment impact, LTV/PMI, DSCR, balloon payments, refinance analysis, points breakeven, and ARM resets. Use `--verify` to recompute the demo figures and assert they match this skill's worked examples (prints PASS/FAIL, exits nonzero on mismatch), and `--help` to list the available classes and functions. The file is primarily meant to be imported as a module (`from lending import LendingAnalysis`) rather than run standalone.
