# Liquidity Management

## Core Concepts

### Cash Flow Forecasting
Project income and expenses monthly for 12+ months:
- **Income sources**: salary, business income, investment income, rental income, side gigs
- **Fixed expenses**: mortgage/rent, insurance, subscriptions, loan payments
- **Variable expenses**: food, utilities, discretionary spending
- **Periodic lumpy expenses**: property taxes, insurance premiums, tuition, estimated taxes
- **Net cash flow**: income - expenses per period → identifies surplus/deficit months

### Income Smoothing (Variable Earners)
For commission, freelance, seasonal, or bonus-heavy income:
- Compute trailing 12-month average income as "base salary equivalent"
- Budget based on base amount, not peak months
- Buffer surplus months into a smoothing reserve (separate from emergency fund)
- Target smoothing reserve: 2-3 months of base expenses
- Draw from reserve in below-average months

### Liquidity Tiers
Classify investable assets by time to access:

| Tier | Access Time | Examples | Typical Yield |
|------|------------|---------|---------------|
| Tier 1 — Immediate | Same day | Checking and savings at your primary bank, money market funds | Low |
| Tier 2 — Short-term | 1-3 business days | High-yield savings at an online bank, brokerage sweep cash, T-bills, bond funds and bond ETFs | Moderate |
| Tier 3 — Medium-term | 1-4 weeks (or penalty cost) | CDs (early-withdrawal penalty), I-bonds (after 1-year lockup) | Moderate-High |
| Tier 4 — Long-term | 30+ days | Real estate, PE/VC, locked alternatives, retirement accounts (pre-59½) | Highest |

Tier notes:
- **Tier 1 vs Tier 2 savings:** the distinction is transfer time, not product type. A savings account at your primary bank offers same-day access (Tier 1); a high-yield savings account at an online bank typically requires a 1-3 business day ACH transfer to reach your checking account (Tier 2).
- **Bond funds and bond ETFs:** both settle T+1 (the US moved to T+1 settlement in May 2024 for equities, ETFs, and mutual funds), so sale proceeds are available in roughly 1-3 business days including transfer to a bank. They belong in Tier 2 for access time — though, unlike deposits, the sale price is subject to market risk.

### CD Laddering
Stagger CD maturities for regular access + higher yields:
- Example: $60K split into 6 CDs maturing every 2 months
- As each CD matures: either use the cash or reinvest at the longest rung
- Benefit: captures term premium while maintaining periodic liquidity
- Variant: 3/6/9/12-month ladder, renewing each at 12 months

### Bond Laddering
Similar concept with Treasury or corporate bonds:
- Annual maturities across 1-5 or 1-10 years
- Provides predictable cash flows and interest rate diversification
- Rungs mature and are reinvested at prevailing rates (automatic rate averaging)

### T-Bill Ladder
Short-duration, high-liquidity ladder:
- 4/8/13/26-week T-bills rolling continuously
- Purchased at Treasury Direct or through brokerage
- State tax exempt (federal only)
- Highly liquid: can sell on secondary market before maturity

### Liquidity Metrics
- **Liquidity ratio**: liquid assets / monthly expenses (target ≥ 3-6)
- **Cash reserve ratio**: cash + near-cash / total portfolio
- **Current ratio** (business): current assets / current liabilities (target > 1.5)
- **Quick ratio** (business): (current assets - inventory) / current liabilities

### Seasonal and Tax Planning
- **Estimated taxes**: quarterly for self-employed (Q1: Apr 15, Q2: Jun 15, Q3: Sep 15, Q4: Jan 15)
- **Property taxes**: typically semi-annual — reserve monthly for escrow-like smoothing
- **Holiday/vacation**: set aside monthly into dedicated sub-account
- **Annual expenses**: insurance premiums, memberships → amortize monthly

### Margin of Safety
Maintain buffer above minimum liquidity requirements:
- Income uncertainty → larger buffer
- Known upcoming large expenses → pre-fund 2-3 months early
- Market correlation: income and portfolio may both decline in recession

## Key Formulas

| Formula | Expression | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Liquidity ratio | Liquid assets / monthly expenses | Adequacy check |
| Net cash flow | Σ income - Σ expenses | Monthly surplus/deficit |
| CD ladder yield | Weighted average of rung yields | Blended return on ladder |
| Smoothing reserve | Base monthly expenses × 2-3 | Buffer for variable income |
| Breakeven penalty | CD early withdrawal penalty / (CD rate - savings rate) | Whether to break CD |

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: CD Ladder Construction
**Given:** $60,000 to deploy, want liquidity every 2 months, 12-month CDs yielding 4.8%
**Calculate:** Ladder structure and blended yield
**Solution:**
- Split into 6 equal CDs of $10,000 each
- Stagger maturities: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 months
- Initial yields may vary by term: 2mo=4.2%, 4mo=4.4%, 6mo=4.5%, 8mo=4.6%, 10mo=4.7%, 12mo=4.8%
- Blended yield ≈ average = 4.53%
- Every 2 months one CD matures → reinvest at 12-month rate (4.8%) or use funds
- After full cycle (12 months), all CDs are 12-month earning 4.8%

### Example 2: Variable Income Smoothing
**Given:** Freelancer with monthly income ranging $3,000-$15,000, average $8,000. Monthly expenses $5,500.
**Calculate:** Base budget and smoothing reserve target
**Solution:**
- Base budget: $5,500/month (essential expenses)
- Average monthly surplus: $8,000 - $5,500 = $2,500
- Smoothing reserve target: $5,500 × 3 = **$16,500**
- In months earning >$8K: direct excess to smoothing reserve until funded
- In months earning <$5.5K: draw from smoothing reserve
- Once reserve is funded, excess above $8K goes to savings/investment goals

## Common Pitfalls
- Illiquidity surprise: needing cash when assets are locked in alternatives or retirement accounts
- Penalty drag from breaking CDs frequently (defeats the purpose of laddering)
- Over-optimizing yield at the expense of access (yield chasing in illiquid instruments)
- Not planning for estimated tax payments (large quarterly cash needs for self-employed)
- Ignoring correlation between income loss and market decline (both happen in recessions)
- Treating credit lines as liquidity (they can be revoked when most needed)

## Cross-References
- **emergency-fund** (wealth-management plugin, Layer 6): first tier of liquidity, must be funded before optimizing
- **lending** (wealth-management plugin, Layer 6): margin loans, HELOCs as backup liquidity (with risks)
- **time-value-of-money** (core plugin, Layer 0): CD/bond pricing, yield calculations
- **debt-management** (wealth-management plugin, Layer 6): debt payments are fixed cash flow obligations
- **savings-goals** (wealth-management plugin, Layer 6): multiple goals compete for available cash flow
- **tax-efficiency** (wealth-management plugin, Layer 5): estimated taxes, tax-loss harvesting timing
- **fixed-income-sovereign** (wealth-management plugin, Layer 2): T-bill ladder mechanics, Treasury Direct
- **financial-planning-workflow** (advisory-practice plugin, Layer 10): cash flow tier structure informs the liquidity analysis in comprehensive financial plans

## Running the script
Run the reference implementation directly:

```
uv run scripts/liquidity_management.py     # PEP 723 header resolves dependencies automatically
python3 scripts/liquidity_management.py    # after: pip install numpy scipy
```

A bare run prints a demo covering liquidity ratios, a 12-month cash flow projection, cash runway, liquidity tier analysis, CD ladder construction, income smoothing, and CD breakeven analysis. Use `--verify` to recompute the demo figures and assert they match this skill's worked examples (prints PASS/FAIL, exits nonzero on mismatch), and `--help` to list the available classes and functions. The file is primarily meant to be imported as a module (`from liquidity_management import LiquidityManagement`) rather than run standalone.
