# Real Assets

## Core Concepts

### Property Income and Return Metrics
- **NOI (Net Operating Income):** effective gross rental income (after vacancy) minus operating expenses; excludes debt service, capex, and depreciation.
- **Cap rate:** NOI divided by property value — the unlevered property yield; lower cap rates mean higher valuations.
- **Income-approach value:** NOI divided by the prevailing cap rate for comparable properties.
- **Cash-on-cash return:** annual pre-tax cash flow (NOI minus debt service) divided by total cash invested — the levered equity yield.
- **GRM (Gross Rent Multiplier):** price divided by gross annual rent; a quick screen that ignores expenses, vacancy, and financing.

### REITs and REIT Metrics
REITs must distribute 90%+ of taxable income as dividends and trade on exchanges like equities. Sectors include residential, office, retail, industrial, data center, healthcare, self-storage, and specialty.

- **FFO (Funds From Operations):** net income plus depreciation minus gains on property sales — the standard REIT earnings measure, since real estate depreciation overstates actual value decline.
- **AFFO (Adjusted FFO):** FFO minus maintenance capex and straight-line rent adjustments — the conservative measure of recurring distributable cash flow.
- **P/FFO and P/AFFO:** the REIT equivalents of P/E; compare within the same sector.
- **NAV premium/discount:** share price relative to per-share net asset value of the underlying properties; indicates market sentiment.

### Infrastructure Investments
Infrastructure assets include toll roads, utilities, pipelines, cell towers, airports, and ports. Characteristics: long asset lives, high barriers to entry, regulated or contracted revenue streams, and inflation-linked cash flows (many contracts include CPI adjustments). Infrastructure provides stable, bond-like income with equity-like upside from traffic/usage growth.

### Leverage in Real Estate
- **LTV (Loan-to-Value):** mortgage amount / property value. Higher LTV means more leverage and more risk. Typical commercial LTV is 60-75%.
- **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio):** NOI / annual debt service. Lenders typically require 1.20x-1.50x minimum. Higher DSCR means more cushion to service debt.

## Direct Real Estate vs REITs: Decision Checklist

Work through these factors before recommending a vehicle:

| Factor | Direct ownership | REITs |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Liquidity | Sales take months; high transaction costs | Trade intraday on exchanges |
| Management | Active management required, or pay a property manager | Passive; professional management included |
| Leverage access | Non-recourse mortgage leverage at attractive LTVs (60-75%), chosen by the investor | Entity-level leverage set by REIT management; investors cannot choose property-level leverage |
| 1031 exchange | Eligible — defer capital gains by exchanging into like-kind property | Not eligible — REIT shares do not qualify |
| Diversification | Concentrated in one or a few properties | A REIT fund spreads across hundreds of properties and multiple sectors |
| Minimum check size | Typically $50K+ equity (down payment plus closing costs) | From one share |

Mapping investor situations to the preferred vehicle:

| Investor situation | Preferred vehicle |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| May need the money within months, or rebalances regularly | REITs |
| Wants control over leverage, tenants, and improvements | Direct |
| Holds appreciated property and wants tax-deferred reinvestment | Direct (1031 exchange) |
| Allocation under ~$50K, or wants broad diversification immediately | REITs |
| Willing to manage tenants and repairs (or pay a manager from rent) | Direct |
| Wants passive, hands-off exposure with no operational involvement | REITs |

## Key Formulas

| Formula | Expression | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| NOI | Gross Rental Income - Operating Expenses | Property income measure |
| Cap Rate | NOI / Property Value | Unlevered property yield |
| Property Value | NOI / Cap Rate | Income-based valuation |
| Cash-on-Cash | Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested | Levered equity return |
| GRM | Price / Gross Annual Rent | Quick screening metric |
| FFO | Net Income + Depreciation - Gains on Sales | REIT earnings measure |
| AFFO | FFO - Maintenance Capex - Straight-Line Rent Adj | Recurring cash flow |
| LTV | Loan Amount / Property Value | Leverage measure |
| DSCR | NOI / Annual Debt Service | Debt coverage measure |

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Property Valuation Using Cap Rate
**Given:** NOI = $100,000 per year, prevailing cap rate for comparable properties = 6%
**Calculate:** Property value
**Solution:**
Value = NOI / Cap Rate = $100,000 / 0.06 = $1,666,667

The property is valued at approximately $1,666,667. If the cap rate compressed to 5% (e.g., in a hot market), the value would rise to $2,000,000 — a 20% increase from a 100bp cap rate decline. This illustrates the sensitivity of real estate values to cap rate changes.

### Example 2: Cash-on-Cash Return with Leverage
**Given:** Property value = $500,000, down payment = $200,000 (40%), mortgage = $300,000 at 6%, NOI = $35,000, annual debt service = $17,000
**Calculate:** Cash-on-cash return
**Solution:**
Annual pre-tax cash flow = NOI - Debt Service = $35,000 - $17,000 = $18,000
Cash-on-Cash Return = $18,000 / $200,000 = 9.0%

Compare to the unlevered cap rate: $35,000 / $500,000 = 7.0%. Leverage boosts the equity return from 7.0% to 9.0% because the cost of debt (6%) is below the cap rate (7.0%) — this is positive leverage. If the mortgage rate exceeded the cap rate, leverage would reduce returns (negative leverage).

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing cap rate with total return — cap rate ignores appreciation, leverage effects, and capital expenditures
- Using P/E instead of P/FFO for REITs — depreciation distorts net income, making P/E misleading for real estate companies
- Ignoring vacancy rates in NOI calculation — always use effective gross income (after vacancy allowance), not gross potential rent
- Overstating returns by ignoring maintenance capex — use AFFO rather than FFO for a realistic view of distributable cash flow

## Running the script

```
uv run scripts/real_assets.py
```

The PEP 723 header resolves the numpy dependency automatically. Alternatively run `python3 scripts/real_assets.py` after `pip install numpy`.

- Bare run prints a demo covering property valuation, cash-on-cash and leverage analysis, REIT metrics, and inflation-adjusted returns.
- `--verify` re-runs the demo computations and asserts the outputs match this skill's worked examples (prints PASS/FAIL, nonzero exit on mismatch).
- `--help` lists the available classes.

The file is primarily meant to be imported as a module, e.g. `from real_assets import PropertyValuation, LeverageMetrics, REITMetrics, RealReturn`.
